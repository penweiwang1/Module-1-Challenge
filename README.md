# Deliverable 3

## Overview of Project
The purpose of the analysis is to use excel to complile data and to use different visualization tools to help analyze if there was a correlation between successful campaigns and launch dates and if there was a correlation with successful campaigns and funding goals. The findings can help understand the factors in creating more successful campaigns in the future.

## Analysis and Challenges:

To analyze the data, different datasets were filtered from the main Kickstarter file using tools like Pivot table so that only the data that were needed were shown and were easier to calculate, instead of having to go through 4000+ unfiltered campaigns one by one. After filtering and other necessary calculations, a visual representation of the data (graphs) were created to help better see the correlation between two factors. 

At times figuring out which field columns belong in the columns and rows for the Pivot table was confusing, but after playing around and adjusting the filters, I eventually was able to figure out the correct placement of the data. 

## Results
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
- May is the best month to launch Theatre campaigns because based on the "Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date" graph it can be seen that the highest success count was in May in comparison to the failed count.
- Another conclusion is that Decemeber is not a good month to launch Theatre campaigns, which can be seen on the same graph as the success to failure rate is about 1 to 1.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- Campaigns with funding goals less than $15,000 and in between $35,000 and $49,999 have a higher success rate.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
- Limitation of the dataset includes the small sample size. There are only a few hundred campaigns per category. If the sample size increased to a few thousand per category, the conclusions/anaylsis would increase in accuracy. 

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Outcomes based on Year
- other subcategory (ie television) outcome vs launch date
- outcomes based on country
